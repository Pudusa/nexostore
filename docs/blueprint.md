## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey professionalism and trustworthiness. The inspiration behind the color is to suggest reliability and expertise. This color is versatile and provides good contrast on both light and dark backgrounds.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), offering a neutral backdrop that focuses attention on the products. This nearly white color provides the brightness appropriate to a light color scheme while maintaining visual separation from true white.
- Accent color: Violet (#9575CD), used for buttons and interactive elements, ensuring they stand out without overpowering the design.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif providing both a modern look and a little warmth or personality; suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, simple icons for navigation and actions, ensuring they are easily recognizable on small screens.
- Mobile-first design with a clean, intuitive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, prioritizing easy navigation and readability.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as smooth loading of product images and animated feedback on button clicks.
